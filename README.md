# MoErgo keyboard configuration

Ivan's source-controlled Glove80 and Go60 configuration, managed by the
current [`moergo-rmk`](https://github.com/colonelpanic8/moergo-rmk) firmware
through RMK's native Rynk protocol.

The repositories, shared firmware layer, configuration model, and primary
control entry point use MoErgo names, reflecting that both boards are
first-class targets. See [Repository naming](docs/repository-rename.md) for
the migration and compatibility policy.

Personal keymap and lighting policy live in the runtime TOMLs in this
repository. Firmware hardware support, reusable lighting/protocol machinery,
the multi-board control CLI, and release packaging live in the pinned
`dependencies/moergo-rmk` submodule.
The firmware build injects [`config/firmware.toml`](config/firmware.toml)
through RMK's external keyboard-configuration path. Its compiled defaults stay
stock apart from the Glove80's bilateral thumb metadata; personal state is
restored with the runtime apply commands.

## Setup

```sh
just init
just check
```

`just init` initializes the firmware repository and its pinned RMK submodule.
`just check` builds the pinned control tool and validates both boards' runtime
TOML offline.
Nix supplies the Rust and native dependencies used by the control tool.

## Apply the keymap

Connect the keyboard over USB or BLE, then run:

```sh
just diff
just apply
```

`config/glove80.toml` is a bidirectional representation of managed runtime
state: Bluetooth advertising name, keymap layers, default layer, brightness/background, output mode,
durable layer scenes and policy, and the generic lighting-extension selection
and optional overlay. Rynk supplies extension effect and palette names without
knowing which effect pack implements them. The current PaletteFX pack includes
the key-reactive Crosshair effect and exposes all seven of its tuning controls
through the same generic parameter interface.

`just diff` compares that TOML with the connected keyboard. `just apply` writes
only differences and verifies the resulting state. Bluetooth-name templates,
keymaps/default layers, and durable lighting scenes survive reboot; other
lighting values are live state whose boot defaults come from firmware. Key
writes are not atomic across the entire keymap, while durable lighting scenes
are replaced atomically.

`bluetooth_name = "Glove80 {slot}"` expands `{slot}` to the active BLE slot's
one-based number, so the keyboard advertises as `Glove80 1`, `Glove80 2`, or
`Glove80 3`. The persistent template can also be managed directly with
`./bin/moergo-control connection name get|set`; it is limited to 16 UTF-8
bytes by the legacy BLE advertising payload.

To inspect or pull state in the other direction:

```sh
just show                         # print canonical live TOML
just pull                         # rewrite config/glove80.toml from the keyboard
./bin/moergo-control config pull /tmp/glove80.toml
```

Pull preserves existing layer IDs when it can parse the destination, but
rewrites the file in canonical TOML form and therefore does not preserve
comments.

### Layer names

Each `[[layer]]`'s `name` is persistent firmware state, not a file-local
label: `just diff` reports a name the keyboard disagrees with, `just apply`
writes it, and `just pull` records a rename made in Rynkbench or elsewhere.
Names are at most 32 UTF-8 bytes. A fresh or reset keyboard starts with stock
compiled names; `just apply` restores the names declared here.

To read or set one without a whole configuration file:

```sh
./bin/moergo-control keymap name             # list every slot
./bin/moergo-control keymap name 3 Games     # rename layer 3
```

### Keys described in one place

A `keys` grid reads well as a whole layer and badly as "these six keys", and
the scene tables put a key's color hundreds of lines from its action.
`[[layer.key]]` entries carry both, addressed by the same selectors the
[lighting model](docs/lighting.md) uses:

```toml
[[layer]]
id = "magic"
name = "Magic"
keys = """…"""

# A black floor over every per-key emitter, then the controls over it.
[[layer.key]]
zone = 1
color = "#000000"

[[layer.key]]
key = [3, 0]
action = "QK_BOOT"
color = "#ff0000"

# One key, several looks: rule arms read top down, first match wins, and the
# inline color is the final unconditional arm. The layer supplies its own
# condition, so `layer = { layer = 2, active = true }` never gets written.
[[layer.key]]
key = [0, 6]
action = "QK_OUTPUT_USB"
color = "#ff0000"

[[layer.key.rule]]
when = { connection = { transport = "usb" } }
color = "#00ff00"

[[layer.key.rule]]
when = { connection = { usb_connected = true } }
color = "#0000ff"

# Emitters that belong to no key take the same shape, minus the action.
[[layer.light]]
led = 87
color = "#202020"
```

Either half can stand alone — an entry with only an `action` is a binding, one
with only lighting is a scene written next to its layer. Within an arm every
named condition must hold together; across arms the first match shows, and an
arm with no conditions is the fallback and must come last. Entries apply in
file order and the last one covering a key wins it, for the action and the
lighting alike, so a broad selector can go first and corrections after it.
That overriding is the difference from `[[lighting.scene]]`, which rejects two
cells for one slot; a layer-attached cell wins the slot instead, including
over a standalone one.

A layer with no `keys` starts transparent. `key = [row, col]` resolves offline
for bindings; every other form is a question about the board, so `just check`
confirms they are well formed and names them, while `just diff` and `just
apply` resolve them through the connected keyboard's topology. Lighting a key
needs a `[lighting]` section to exist, since synthesizing one would claim the
brightness, background and policy values in it. The keyboard stores a grid and
resolved cells rather than the selectors that described them, so `just pull`
writes layers back as `keys` and lighting back as `led` cells.

This is runtime configuration only. The compiled `[[keymap.layer]]` grids in
[`config/firmware.toml`](config/firmware.toml) are parsed by RMK's
`keyboard.toml` schema and take neither form.

The Go60's managed runtime state lives in
[config/go60.toml](config/go60.toml). Runtime TOML declares its logical
5×14 matrix and carries the persisted policy for both pointing devices; the
current policy makes device 0 (the left trackpad) scroll and device 1 (the
right trackpad) move the cursor. If only one Rynk USB device is connected, the
Go60 recipes autodetect it:

    just go60-diff
    just go60-apply
    just go60-pull

When both keyboards are connected, pass the Go60's Rynk HID path explicitly:

    just go60-apply /dev/hidraw12

The HID number can change after reconnecting. Identify the Go60 Rynk
interface before applying rather than reusing a stale path.

The same configuration commands also accept the experimental JSON backup
format from the MoErgo Layout Editor:

```sh
./bin/moergo-control config validate layout.json
./bin/moergo-control config diff layout.json
./bin/moergo-control config apply layout.json
./bin/moergo-control config pull layout.json --format moergo-json
./bin/moergo-control config show --format moergo-json
```

JSON import manages the runtime keymap and default layer; the editor format has
no Rynk lighting state. Pulling over an existing editor JSON preserves its
identity, layer names, macros, combos, custom behavior definitions, and other
editor-owned sections. A binding with no faithful Rynk/editor equivalent is
rejected with its exact layer and key position rather than silently changed.
The Layout Editor itself describes JSON import/export as experimental, so the
schema may evolve.

For transport selection or any other CLI command, use the wrapper from the
active direnv environment. It runs the pinned RMK workspace with Cargo
directly; the environment supplies the Rust toolchain and native BLE build
dependencies:

```sh
./bin/moergo-control --usb keymap read --all
./bin/moergo-control --ble version
./bin/moergo-control --usb lighting caps
./bin/moergo-control --usb device-data
```

Run `./bin/moergo-control --help` for the complete interface. The existing
`./bin/glove80-control` path remains as a compatibility shim.

## Firmware

Build release firmware from the exact pinned product stack with:

```sh
just firmware
```

Artifacts are written under `dependencies/moergo-rmk/dist/`. Compiled defaults
remain stock. After erased persistent storage, run `just apply` to restore the
personal Glove80 runtime configuration.

The compact counterpart for the Go60 RMK port lives in
[`config/go60-firmware.toml`](config/go60-firmware.toml). Build both Go60
halves from that configuration with:

```sh
just go60-firmware
```

The bundle is written under `dependencies/moergo-rmk/dist/go60/`. The Go60
port automatically prefers the board's half-duplex UART/TRRS link between
halves and falls back to BLE between halves when the cable is absent. Host
communication remains independently selectable between USB and BLE. Hardware
qualification is still required.

The product repository's stock Go60 configuration is canonical for every
compiled setting. `just firmware-config-check` compares the outer firmware
TOMLs semantically with their pinned stock files, allowing only the Glove80
bilateral-thumb metadata. After building, the Go60 reference check compares the
resulting platform profile with a stock build from the same source. When that
source has a profile-aware GitHub release, the locally reproduced stock UF2
hashes must also match the published bundle. After erased persistent storage,
run `just go60-apply <device>` to restore the personal runtime configuration.

The build embeds three independently checkable Git identities in the Rynk
firmware label: this configuration repository's commit, the pinned
`moergo-rmk` commit and board-crate semver, and the pinned RMK submodule's full
`git describe` identity. Rynk also reports RMK's structured semantic version.
The release manifest records the full configuration, product, and RMK commits.
A dirty working tree is marked in both places.

The `bin/glove80-safe-flash` and `bin/go60-safe-flash` helpers share one flashing
implementation. Both validate the requested image and any `--recover` image
against the selected half's family ID and application flash range before
entering the bootloader. Their health watch queries Rynk on the named board;
`--peripheral` additionally requires the right-half split connection. A failed
health watch can trigger recovery, so disconnect other Rynk USB keyboards
before using these helpers. `--no-watch` skips the health watch, not image
validation. Run `just flash-check` for the simulated-device regression tests.

## Lighting controls and indicators

See [Lighting model](docs/lighting.md) for the topology, selector syntax,
matrix/zone regions, resolution behavior, and compositor order.

Lighting has a three-state output policy: always on, always off, or on only
while USB power is present. In plugged-in-only mode each half evaluates its
own VBUS independently; USB power does not need to be the selected transport.
The final hardware driver caps each color channel at 230/255 (about 90%).

- Hold the left-thumb Magic key to temporarily wake lighting and show the
  information view without changing the selected policy.
- Press `Magic+T` to cycle always on → always off → plugged-in only. `T`
  reports the selected policy in green, red, or blue respectively.
- Press `Magic+R` to toggle the maintenance lock. `R` is green while the lock
  is off and fully unattended configuration and firmware pushes are allowed,
  and red while the lock is engaged. This firmware defaults the lock to off.
- The Magic lighting controls use the familiar WASD cluster plus left/right
  arrows: `W`/`S` raise and lower overall brightness, `E` toggles PaletteFX,
  `T` cycles the lighting policy, left/right cycle effects backward/forward,
  and `C` cycles palettes. Brightness is yellow, palette cycling is magenta,
  effect cycling is white, and both toggles report their live state. PaletteFX
  starts off and toggles on at half brightness.
- While lighting is on, F-keys `F1` through `F5` show non-default layers 1
  through 5 in blue while active. Inactive layers are transparent/dark; layer
  0 has no indicator because it is always active.
- While Games (layer 3) is active, `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` are red. The
  left-thumb Backspace position is amber because its Games action is Space.
- While Magic is held, the five keys below the top key in each outer column
  form bottom-up battery bars for the corresponding half. Each segment is a
  20% band; green is normal, amber/red is low, and blue means charging.

The battery bars intentionally use five segments.

## Agent attention lighting

This repository also provides `rmk-attentiond`, a small local daemon that maps
Codex and Claude Code approval/input requests onto expiring F1-F3 lighting
overlays. See [RMK Agent Attention](docs/rmk-agent-attention.md) for behavior,
Claude hook configuration, and development commands.

## Updating `moergo-rmk`

Update deliberately, inspect the upstream changes, and then commit the new
gitlink:

```sh
git submodule update --remote dependencies/moergo-rmk
git -C dependencies/moergo-rmk log --oneline --decorate ORIG_HEAD..HEAD
just check
git add dependencies/moergo-rmk
```

The submodule tracks upstream `master`, but ordinary clones and builds always
use the exact commit recorded by this repository.
